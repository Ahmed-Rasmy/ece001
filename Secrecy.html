               <h2>Secrecy</h2>
               <p>Protecting confidential data is a major worldwide challenge. Classical cryptography is fast and scalable, but is broken by quantum algorithms. Quantum cryptography is unclonable, but requires quantum installations that are more expensive, slower, and less scalable than classical optical networks.</p>
               <p>Here we show a perfect secrecy cryptography in classical optical channels. The system exploits correlated chaotic wavepackets, which are mixed in inexpensive and CMOS compatible silicon chips. The chips can generate 0.1 Tbit of different keys for every mm of length of the input channel, and require the transmission of an amount of data that can be as small as 1/1000 of the messageâ€™s length. </p>
               <p>The main advantage of these algorithms is speed, and the main disadvantage is their security, which relies on computational and provable security arguments and not on unconditional proofs. A major threat lies in the development of quantum computers, which are predicted to crack any of these ciphers in a short period of time </p>

        <h2>Two Types of Secrecy</h2>
               <p>The major goal of cryptography is to prevent data from being read by any third party. Most transmission systems use a private-key cryptosystem. This system uses a secret key to encrypt and decrypt data which is shared between the sender and receiver. The private keys are distributed and destroyed periodically. One must secure the key from unauthorized access, because any party that has the key can decrypt the encrypted information.</p>
               <p>Storage encryption refers to the application of cryptographic techniques on data, both during transit and while on storage media. Storage encryption is gaining popularity among enterprises that use storage area networks (SANs). Secrecy in storage is maintained by storing data in encrypted form. The user has to provide the key to the computer only at the beginning of a session to access the data and it then takes care of encryption and decryption throughout the course of normal use. Hardware devices can also be used for PCs to automatically encrypt all information stored on disk. </p>
