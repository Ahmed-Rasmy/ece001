               <h2>Integrity</h2>
               <p>Threats to Data Integrity
                When sensitive information is exchanged, the receiver must have the assurance that the message has come intact from the intended sender and is not modified inadvertently or otherwise. There are two different types of data integrity threats, namely passive and active.</p>
               <p>Passive Threats
                This type of threats exists due to accidental changes in data.
                
                These data errors are likely to occur due to noise in a communication channel. Also, the data may get corrupted while the file is stored on a disk.
                
                Error-correcting codes and simple checksums like Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) are used to detect the loss of data integrity. In these techniques, a digest of data is computed mathematically and appended to the data. </p>
               <p>Active Threats
                In this type of threats, an attacker can manipulate the data with malicious intent.
                
                At simplest level, if data is without digest, it can be modified without detection. The system can use techniques of appending CRC to data for detecting any active modification.
                
                At higher level of threat, attacker may modify data and try to derive new digest for modified data from exiting digest. This is possible if the digest is computed using simple mechanisms such as CRC </p>

        <h2>Two Types of Integrity</h2>
               <p>We can use cryptography to provide a means to ensure that data is not altered during transmission, i.e. its integrity is preserved. In electronic funds transfer, it is very important that integrity be maintained. A bank can lose millions if a transaction is illicitly intercepted. Cryptographic techniques are employed to prevent accidental or intentional modification of data during transmission, leading to erroneous actions. One of the ways to ensure integrity is to perform a checksum on the information being transmitted and to transmit the checksum in an encrypted form as well.</p>
               <p>Integrity in storage had been ensured by access control systems with lock and keys and other guards to prevent unauthorized access to stored data. The existence of computer viruses has changed the scenario and the need of integrity against intentional attack has become a problem of epic proportions. Cryptographic checksums to ascertain validity of stored data are of help here.</p>

            <h2>Integrity in transmission</h2>
            <p>The information is received on the other end and again checksummed. The transmitted checksum is decrypted and compared with the previous checksum. If the checksums agree, the information is most likely unaltered.</p>

            <h2>Integrity in storage</h2>
            <p>As in the case of transmission, a cryptographic checksum is produced and compared to the expected value. However, storage media are more vulnerable to attacks than transmission channels due to longer exposure and larger volumes of information. </p>
